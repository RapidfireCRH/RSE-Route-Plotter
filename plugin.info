Here are the 3 methods contained in the plugin. They all return a predefined structure, star_st:

public struct star_st{

    public string name;
    
    public coord_st coord;
    
}

public struct coord_st{

    public double x;
    
    public double y;
    
    public double z;
    
}

Here are the 4 methods:

1. star_st findnext(star_st curr, star_st dest, int variation=20, maxdist=0)

    finds the next star between curr and dest with less then variation angle.
    
2. star_st zen(star_st curr, numofjumps=20,mindist=18000)

    find true zen in your life by having the computer decide your fate. plots random plots across the galaxy. By default will try to give approximately 20k plots (18000).
       
3. star_st searchbyname(string starname)

    finds a star through EDSM and returns its star_st, or a blank star_st if it cannot be found
    
4. star_st currentlocation(string username)

    finds a user in EDSM and extracts their current location. This requires that the profile be public
